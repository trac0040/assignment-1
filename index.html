		<blockquote><strong class="quote1">&ldquo;</strong>The beet is the most intense of vegetables. The radish, admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of the radish is a cold fire, the fire of discontent not of passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs through tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity. Beets are deadly serious.<strong class="quote2">&rdquo;</strong></blockquote>
